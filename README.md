**This version runs on Windows OS with standard Mojang installations**  

Install Java at oracle.com  

   1. Join the Minecraft server at play.thekittymine.com - Java 1.21.4  
   2. Run the jar from any directory and choose 'Mining Only' or 'Sync'  
   3. Attempt a hash by walking through the portal or /trigger tryhash  

If you have issues getting information from the blockchain, then  
uninstall and reinstall Minecraft to 'default' your directory.  
(The program calls the directory from user home to Roaming/.minecraft/logs)  


**If this is your first time running KMCoin please read.**  

To be minted on the ledger and player_info page a new player must run KMCoin while mining any block.  
This block and the private key created by the player's password may never be changed once this block  
is mined. To check if a player has been added to the player_info page, see 'Sync with Chain' below.  
Once a player is added to the this page, they never have to run KMCoin again to receive block rewards.  

**DO NOT USE KEYBOARD UNTIL FIRST HASH IS INPUT AFTER SUCCESSFULL ATTEMPT**  
**THIS OCCURS 1-2 SECONDS AFTER TELEPORTING BACK TO THE LOBBY**  


*Mining Only*  

Use Player Name as seen in the Minecraft server. Leave Minecraft open as full screen or windowed. This  
mode will not output any block information. It will write the player's hash to ledger_current and update  
their balance to players running KMCoin.  


*Sync with Chain*  

Do command !sync in the kmcbot-chat located in the discord channel at discord.gg/thekittymine.  
Download the files and click 'Ready'.  

*The jar will execute from any directory.*  

**The program calls the players keyboard to automatically input their hash (public key)**  
**If a player augments this field on their first block, then their coins will be irretrievable**  
**This is due to the nature of how KMCoin reads transactions from the player_info page**
